# Proto4j-Swing

This project contains a new way of creating GUIs with Java-Swing. Masks are generated by processing placed annotations. By now, every component has to be declared in the class where the target component is defined. This framework can be modified with extensions and <s>better</s> implementations of the `Entry` class.

A general instruction on how to use this framework and how extensions can  be created and implemented is provided [here Â»](https://proto4j.github.io/proto4j-swing/)

## Example usage

This framework is built to be user-friendly when working with generated GUI instances. It is recommended to access the declared fields over a `FieldReference` object, because this class is thread-safe.

The way of generating a GUI instance is very simple:
````java
Entry<MyGUI> entry = Entry.of(MyGUI.class);
// or with constructor arguments
Entry<MyGUI> entry = Entry.of(MyGui.class, "argument1", "argument2");
````

The GUI instance is wrapped into the `Entry` object, because it provides some utility methods and general information that were collected during the generation process. If nested GUIs are found and generated, they can be queried by providing the field's name:

````java
Entry<MyGUI> entry = Entry.of(MyGUI.class);
// this method is not type safe, it s recommended to use Entry<?> instead.
Entry<MyNestedGUI> nestedEntry = entry.getNestedGUI("fieldName", MyNestedGUI.class);
````
